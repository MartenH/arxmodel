# arxmodel

Loads AUTOSAR models (ARXML) the way AUTOSAR tools see them: many files, one model. Elements
split across files are merged by the AUTOSAR merge model, edits go back to the files they came
from, and every element and value points back to its file and line.

Built on [flatxml](https://github.com/MartenH/flatxml), which parses, shares names across files,
and gives a merged view over many documents by rules its caller supplies. arxmodel supplies the
AUTOSAR rules.

## No AUTOSAR material here

No AUTOSAR schema (XSD), no ARXML file and no table generated from either is committed: not as
code, not as test data, not in a comment. The merge rules (split keys, which aggregations may be
split, which are ordered, how many children each allows) are read at load time from the AUTOSAR
schema the user has, the one the files declare. Tests use synthetic schemas and documents
written here. Runs against real schemas and files happen locally, and record numbers only.
